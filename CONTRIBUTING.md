# How to Contribute

We’re thrilled that you’d like to add your DApp to the Omnex ecosystem! To help ensure a smooth and efficient submission process, please follow the guidelines below.

## Submission Process

All DApp submissions are managed through GitHub Pull Requests (PRs), which is our preferred and most efficient method.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Begin by forking this repository to your personal GitHub account.

### Step 2: Create a New DApp File

1. Navigate to the `dapps/` directory.  
2. Make a copy of the `_template.json` file.  
3. Rename your copy to `your-dapp-name.json`. Use all lowercase letters and hyphens to separate words.  
4. Fill in your DApp’s details in the JSON file according to the provided structure.

### Step 3: Submit a Pull Request

1. Commit your new JSON file to your forked repository.  
2. Open a new Pull Request from your fork to the `main` branch of this repository.  
3. The PR will include a pre-filled template—please complete all sections accurately.

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks:** Once your PR is submitted, a GitHub Action will run automated checks to ensure proper formatting and completeness.  
2. **Team Review:** The Omnex team will manually review your submission for correctness and overall quality.  
3. **Approval & Merge:** Upon approval, your PR will be merged, and your DApp will be added to the official Omnex website automatically.

## Not a Developer?

If you’re not familiar with GitHub, don’t worry — you can submit your DApp through our online submission form. Our team will handle creating the Pull Request on your behalf.
